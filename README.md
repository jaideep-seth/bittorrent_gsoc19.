# My GSoC 19 journey with INCF

## How did i get into GSoC?

* I was first introduced into INCF and PyOpenWorm specifically by my mentor Arnab Banerjee in January of 2019.

* Due to the support of my lead mentor Mark Watts i was able to merge my code and its tests, ultimately getting onto the 
  OpenWorm Foundation's Peoples page. [(check Jaideep Seth)](http://openworm.org/people.html)

* I enjoyed interacting with senior contributors like Mr Chee Wai Lee inorder to acquire [OpenWorm Badges.](https://www.badgelist.com/u/Jaideep_Seth)

* I was motivated by the progress my mentors have made within INCF. From being GSoC Students, to Mentors, then onto
  Senior Contributors.
