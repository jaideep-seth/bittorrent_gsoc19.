# My GSoC 19 journey with INCF

## How did i get into GSoC?

* I was first introduced into INCF and PyOpenWorm specifically by my mentor Arnab Banerjee in January of 2019.

* Due to the support of my lead mentor Mark Watts i was able to merge my code and its tests, ultimately getting onto the 
  OpenWorm Foundation's Peoples page. [(check Jaideep Seth)](http://openworm.org/people.html)

* I enjoyed interacting with senior contributors like Mr Chee Wai Lee inorder to acquire [OpenWorm Badges.](https://www.badgelist.com/u/Jaideep_Seth)

* I was motivated by the progress my mentors have made within INCF. From being GSoC Students, to Mentors, then onto
  Senior Contributors.

## What have i learned till now?

* Python Packaging (PyPI)

* Creating issues to track project progress

* Using setuptools for installing project dependencies

* Using Sphinx for documentation

* Writing self-contained tests by using the setUp and tearDown methods of unittest.

* To coordinate with researchers across different Time Zones.


## How do i feel about GSoC?

* I am grateful to the Google Summer of Code program as it has afforded me the opportunity to work with consummate professionals within INCF.

* It has given me the chance to become a long term contributor and grow within the INCF organization!
